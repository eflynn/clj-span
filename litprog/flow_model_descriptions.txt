* Carbon (CO2Removed)

The amount of carbon sequestration produced is distributed among the
consumers (carbon emitters) according to their relative use values
after being initially reduced by the sink values due to landscape
emissions.

1. Compute ha-per-cell given cell-width and cell-height in meters.

2. Draw sample worlds.

   1. Multiply values in source, sink, and use layers by ha-per-cell.

   2. Create 10 sample layers each for source, sink, and use by
      drawing a deterministic value from each pixel's distribution.

   3. For each sample world (i.e. one sample layer each for source, sink, and use):

      1. Calculate the total source, sink, and use values (sum across all pixels).

      2. Split the total source into amount sunk per pixel and source
         remaining per pixel by comparing it with the total
         sink. (computing actual sink)

      3. Split the total source into amount used per pixel and source
         remaining per pixel by comparing it with the total
         use. (computing possible use)

      4. Split the post-sink source remaining into amount used per
         pixel and source remaining per pixel by comparing it with the
         total use. (computing actual use)

      5. Normalize all source and use values between [0-1] by dividing
         by their totals.

      6. Pair every source pixel with every sink pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the actual
         sink value. This calculates the amount each source pixel
         loses to each sink pixel.

      7. Pair every source pixel with every use pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the
         possible use value. This calculates the possible amount each
         source pixel contributes to each use pixel.

      8. Pair every source pixel with every use pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the actual
         use value. This calculates the actual amount each source
         pixel contributes to each use pixel.

      9. For each triplet combination of source, sink, and use pixels,
         multiply the normalized source value by the normalized use
         value and then by the actual sink value to compute the effect
         of each sink on each pair of source and use point.

3. Combine sample worlds.

   1. Organize all the information from the draw sample worlds step by
      use point. {use-point -> [possible-weight actual-weight sink-effects]}

   2. Merge all worlds together by building up a distribution of the
      possible-weight, actual-weight, and sink-effects values per use
      pixel from the 10 Monte Carlo world samples.

   3. Divide the final possible-weight, actual-weight, and
      sink-effects values by ha-per-cell to turn them back into
      densities for comparison with the original input layers.
* Line of Sight (LineOfSight)

Finds a line of sight path between source and use points, checks
for obstructions, and determines (using elevation info) how much of
the source element can be seen from the use point.  A distance
decay function is applied to the results to compute the visual
utility originating from the source point.

- For each pair of source point and use point, wherein the points are
   not in the same location (no in situ use):

  1. Compute the euclidean distance in meters between the center of
     the source and use pixels.

  2. Calculate the source decay at this distance, and proceed if
     positive. Otherwise, there is no view service between this
     source and use point.

  3. Look up the elevation at every point between the source and use
     locations.

  4. Take the difference in meters between each elevation along this
     view line and the use point's elevation. (compute the rises)

  5. Calculate the euclidean distance in meters between every point
     along this view line and the use location. (compute the runs)

  6. Calculate each of the view obstruction slopes along the view
     line by dividing each rise by its corresponding run.

  7. Select the maximum view obstruction slope from these values to
     be the determinant of how much of the source we can and cannot
     see along this view line.

  8. Compute the view elevation in meters projected onto the source
     by multiplying the maximum view obstruction slope by the
     euclidean distance between the source and use points in meters
     and adding this value to the use elevation.

  9. If the projected view elevation is negative (because the view
     obstruction slope was negative), then set it to 0.

  10. If the slope is positive, then we are looking up, so only count
      the visible part of the source value. If the projected view
      elevation is greater than the source elevation, then we can't
      see it, so the source value is 0. Otherwise, the visible source
      value is the fraction of the total source elevation above the
      projected view elevation times the total source value.

  11. If the slope is negative, then we are looking straight ahead or
      down, so count the whole feature if we can see any part of
      it. Thus, if the projected view elevation is greater than the
      source elevation, we can't see it, and the visible source value
      is 0. Otherwise, the visible source value is the total source
      value.

  12. Finally, multiply the visible source value by the source decay
      at that distance to compute the possible weight transmitted
      from this source point to the use point.

  13. If the possible weight is below the transition threshold, then
      there is no service along this view line. Otherwise, continue
      with the next step.

  14. For each sink location along the sight line, calculate the
      visible sink value using the same algorithm as with the source
      (e.g. project view elevation onto sink, multiply sink value by
      fraction of sink elevation visible above the project view
      elevation), and finally multiply the visible sink value by the
      sink decay at its distance from the use point.

  15. Compute the actual weight as the possible weight minus the sum
      of the sink effects along the sight line. If this value is
      negative (because sinks outweigh the source value), set it
      to 0.

- Source Decay: ramp up in 1 mile, slow decay to 5 miles, fast decay to 20 miles, moderate decay to 40 miles, then gone

- Sink Decay: slow decay to 1/2 mile, fast decay to 1 mile, gone after 1 mile
