* Carbon (CO2Removed)

The amount of carbon sequestration produced is distributed among the
consumers (carbon emitters) according to their relative use values
after being initially reduced by the sink values due to landscape
emissions.

1. Compute ha-per-cell given cell-width and cell-height in meters.

2. Draw sample worlds.

   1. Multiply values in source, sink, and use layers by ha-per-cell.

   2. Create 10 sample layers each for source, sink, and use by
      drawing a deterministic value from each pixel's distribution.

   3. For each sample world (i.e. one sample layer each for source, sink, and use):

      1. Calculate the total source, sink, and use values (sum across all pixels).

      2. Split the total source into amount sunk per pixel and source
         remaining per pixel by comparing it with the total
         sink. (computing actual sink)

      3. Split the total source into amount used per pixel and source
         remaining per pixel by comparing it with the total
         use. (computing possible use)

      4. Split the post-sink source remaining into amount used per
         pixel and source remaining per pixel by comparing it with the
         total use. (computing actual use)

      5. Normalize all source and use values between [0-1] by dividing
         by their totals.

      6. Pair every source pixel with every sink pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the actual
         sink value. This calculates the amount each source pixel
         loses to each sink pixel.

      7. Pair every source pixel with every use pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the
         possible use value. This calculates the possible amount each
         source pixel contributes to each use pixel.

      8. Pair every source pixel with every use pixel, and for each
         such pair, multiply the normalized source value by the actual
         use value. This calculates the actual amount each source
         pixel contributes to each use pixel.

      9. For each triplet combination of source, sink, and use pixels,
         multiply the normalized source value by the normalized use
         value and then by the actual sink value to compute the effect
         of each sink on each pair of source and use point.

3. Combine sample worlds.

   1. Organize all the information from the draw sample worlds step by
      use point. {use-point -> [possible-weight actual-weight sink-effects]}

   2. Merge all worlds together by building up a distribution of the
      possible-weight, actual-weight, and sink-effects values per use
      pixel from the 10 Monte Carlo world samples.

   3. Divide the final possible-weight, actual-weight, and
      sink-effects values by ha-per-cell to turn them back into
      densities for comparison with the original input layers.
